## 📚 Case Study: Documenting Life Through Places

### 🧩 The Problem
Users who travel often or document field work (e.g., researchers, inspectors, adventurers) struggled with keeping their photo libraries organized with context. Memories were disconnected from locations, and standard camera apps didn’t provide location metadata in a user-friendly format.  

There was **no intuitive app** that could **merge photos, GPS data, maps, and memory journaling** into a seamless experience.

### 💡 The Solution
We created **GSP Camera Map** — the ultimate memory-mapping camera app.  

- Capture moments and locations in one tap  
- Relive experiences visually *and* geographically  
- Organize, search, and share your adventures with rich context  
- Designed for travelers, explorers, journalists, and anyone who values where memories happen
